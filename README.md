# Inventory & Shop System

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a comprehensive inventory and shop system for games, focusing on performance and optimization. The system is designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) and Service Locator design patterns to ensure efficient management and scalability. Additionally, Scriptable Objects are utilized to handle the numerous items in the game, further enhancing optimization.

## Key Features

**Drag and Drop Functionality:** Allows players to easily manage their inventory by dragging and dropping items.

**Buy and Sell System:** Players can purchase and sell items within the game.

**Item Description Panel:** Provides detailed information about each item.

**Weight System:** Manages the weight of items, affecting the player's carrying capacity.

**Coin System:** Tracks the player's currency for transactions.

**Item Rarity System:** Categorizes items based on their rarity.

**Item Types:** Supports various item types such as materials, treasures, weapons, and consumables.

**Item Filter:** Enables filtering of items based on their type.

**Pixelated UI and Icons:** Features a visually appealing pixelated user interface and icons, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the game.

## Design Patterns

**MVC(Model-View-Controller):** Separates the application logic into three interconnected components, improving code maintainability and scalability.

**Service Locator:** Provides a centralized registry for services, reducing dependencies and improving performance.

## Optimization Techniques

**Scriptable Objects:** Used to manage the large number of items efficiently, reducing memory overhead and improving performance.

## Visuals

The project includes a stylish pixelated UI and icons, giving the game a unique and cool appearance.
